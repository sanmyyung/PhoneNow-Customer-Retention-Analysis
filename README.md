## Analysis and Recommendations

1. **High-Risk Customer Segments**:
   - Month-to-month contract holders
   - Fiber optic internet service users
   - Customers using electronic check as payment method
   
   *Recommendation*: Develop targeted retention strategies for these high-risk segments, such as offering incentives to switch to longer-term contracts or promoting the benefits of automatic payment methods.

2. **Contract Type Impact**:
   The significantly higher churn rate for month-to-month contracts suggests that customers with shorter commitments are more likely to leave.
   
   *Recommendation*: Encourage customers to opt for longer-term contracts by offering discounts or additional services for one-year or two-year commitments.

3. **Internet Service Optimization**:
   Fiber optic customers show the highest churn rate, which could indicate service quality issues or pricing concerns.
   
   *Recommendation*: Investigate the reasons for high churn in fiber optic services. Consider improving service quality, adjusting pricing, or enhancing customer support for this segment.

4. **Payment Method Evaluation**:
   Electronic check users have the highest churn rate, while credit card (automatic) users have the lowest.
   
   *Recommendation*: Promote automatic payment methods, especially credit card payments, by highlighting their convenience and potentially offering incentives for switching.

5. **Senior Citizen and Dependent Considerations**:
   With 25% of customers being senior citizens and only 17% having dependents, there may be opportunities to tailor services for these segments.
   
   *Recommendation*: Develop specialized plans or services catering to senior citizens and families with dependents to improve retention in these segments.

6. **Partner Status Impact**:
   More customers have partners than those without. This could be leveraged for retention strategies.
   
   *Recommendation*: Create family or partner plans that offer better value for customers with partners, encouraging them to stay with the service.

## Conclusion
The PhoneNow customer retention analysis reveals several key areas for improvement. By focusing on high-risk segments, optimizing contract offerings, addressing internet service issues, and promoting more stable payment methods, PhoneNow can work towards reducing its overall churn rate of 26.54%. 

Implementing the recommended strategies should help in retaining more customers, particularly those in month-to-month contracts and using fiber optic services. Additionally, tailoring offerings for specific demographic groups like senior citizens and families can further enhance customer loyalty and retention.

## Future Steps
1. Conduct surveys or interviews with churned customers to gain deeper insights into their reasons for leaving.
2. Implement A/B testing of retention strategies to measure their effectiveness.
3. Develop a predictive churn model to proactively identify at-risk customers.
4. Regularly update the dashboard and analysis to track the impact of implemented retention strategies.

By continuously monitoring these metrics and adapting strategies based on the findings, PhoneNow can work towards improving its customer retention and overall business performance.
